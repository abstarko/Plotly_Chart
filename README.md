# Plotly_Chart
## Project Overview
Creating an interactive dashboard that allows test subjects to look up their data using their Test Subject ID Number. Volunteers can use this information and take a gander and see what top 10 bacteria could be living in their navel! If Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, volunteers can use this to idenityfy what that species is found living in their belly button.
